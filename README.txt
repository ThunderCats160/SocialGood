README

This project is the combined work of Michael Martin, Harry Eldridge,Kevin Meurer, and Robert Pinter.

We are submitting a ZIP containing a runnable Jar, PDFs of our surveys (3 before changes were made and 3 after), and a Word document
explaining the changes we made due to feedback received from the surveys.
Additionally, we are submitting an HTML file and JNLP file.

Due to security restrictions on our browser, our project is not runnable through the HTML, but we are submitting the HTML and JNLP files regardless.


The code is broken into a variety of packages: 
unitTests, Units, Panels, Moves, Main, Interfaces, Buttons, and ActionListeners.
Each package is responsible for the code components of its type. 

To run the program, we recommend running the Runnable Jar.


Extra Credit done:
We extend JButton, JPanel to create our own unique user interface.
